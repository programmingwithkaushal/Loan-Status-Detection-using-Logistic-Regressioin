<h1>💸 Loan Detection System using Logistic Regression</h1>

<p>
Welcome to the <strong>Loan Detection System</strong>, a machine learning project designed to predict the approval status of a loan application using <strong>Logistic Regression</strong>. This solution leverages statistical insights to assist financial institutions in making smarter, data-driven decisions.
</p>

<h2>🚀 Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This notebook presents a supervised learning approach for classifying loan applications into <strong>Approved</strong> or <strong>Rejected</strong> categories based on applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and more.
</p>

<p>
The model is trained using the <strong>Logistic Regression</strong> algorithm, known for its effectiveness in binary classification tasks. With proper feature engineering, data preprocessing, and model tuning, this system achieves a reliable performance in predicting loan approvals.
</p>
